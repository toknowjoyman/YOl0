# yol0: You only live now
Working title for the interface that combines the features of 'todos 521' and 'ahora-aqui' on a multiplatform login screen that enables users to focus on thier goals (combining what important to them and whats urgent for the world around them)

## reason to be

Ever used a computer and not do what you planned to do? What happens when you only do things using computers? How do you get shit done? When you do get shit done, who was it for? Was it worth it? Do you remember what you did?

Since conciousness only exists in the moment, lets value it while we use computers and so we can use computing to collate the actions of our life for our own good. 

### thinking it through

We plan using to do's (ideally things that are important to us) but we act using instict in response to what is urgent around us. 

If we document as we act, and we can see our plan(todos) all along - will we be more easily aligned with our goals?

What is the best way to see both these entities (our plans and our ongoing actions) at the same time?

How do we integrate these 2 and a calendar into a page dashboard - todos and doings

what about a tree chart to visualize actions AND todos?? 2 charts!?

what about the report parser, for resumes etc, how do we ask it to avoid entries like grocery lists?

How is all of this going to be super easy to use with minimum number of click with 00 (absolutley fucking zero) resistence for the user to document using this app before they actually do their task at hand (no beats!!, although a beat would enable users to think through things before jumping into it)? So zero resitence but 1 beat UI. 

ok bring it!
