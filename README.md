You only live now
Working title for the interface that combines the features of 'todos 521' and 'ahora-aqui' on a multiplatform login screen that enables users to focus on thier goals (combining what important to them and whats urgent for the world around them)

## reason to be

Ever used a computer and not do what you planned to do? What happens when you only do things using computers? How do you get shit done? When you do get shit done, who was it for? Was it worth it? Do you remember what you did?

Since conciousness only exists in the moment, lets value it while we use computers and so we can use computing to collate the actions of our life for our own good.
